Opens all (or specific) external links in a new window. XHTML Strict compliant and search engine optimized (SEO).

== Description ==
Opens external links (starting with `http://` or `https://`) in a separate browser tab (or window). You can also specify certain URLs that should either be forced to open in a new window or ignored.
The plugin produces XHTML Strict compliant code and is also search engine optimized (SEO).
This is done using JavaScript's `window.open()`-function.

Most other plugins perform a hack by altering the `target` parameter (i.e. `<a href="http://somewhere.example" target="_blank">`). That method is not XHTML Strict compliant.
This plugin handles the links client-side, which lets search engines follow the links properly. Also, if a browser does not support JavaScript, the plugin is simply inactive, and does not result in any errors.
